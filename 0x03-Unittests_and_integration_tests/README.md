## Project Overview
This project focuses on unit testing and integration testing in Python. The goal is to ensure that individual functions and the interactions between different parts of the code work as expected.

### Unit Testing
Unit testing is the process of testing individual functions to ensure they return expected results for different sets of inputs. Unit tests should only test the logic within the function and mock any external calls.

### Integration Testing
Integration tests aim to test code paths end-to-end, ensuring that interactions between different parts of the code work correctly. Only low-level functions that make external calls are mocked.

## Execution
Execute your tests with:
```sh
$ python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py
