# 0x01. Python - Async

## Description

This project covers the basics of asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` module. You will learn how to use `async` and `await` syntax, execute async programs, run concurrent coroutines, create asyncio tasks, and utilize the `random` module.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:
- `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create `asyncio` tasks
- How to use the `random` module

## Requirements

- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7).
- All files should end with a new line.
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x).
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- All modules should have documentation.
- All functions should have documentation.
